= Getting Jandex

== Using Jandex in a Maven Project

Just add the following to your POM:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
    <artifactId>jandex</artifactId>
    <version>${version.jandex}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Downloading Jandex

If you don't use Maven, you can download the Jandex JAR link:https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.smallrye%20a:jandex[from Maven Central].
This JAR is completely self-sufficient and doesn't require any dependencies.
